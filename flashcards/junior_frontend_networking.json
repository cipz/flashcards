      "question": "What is HTTP, and how does it work?",
      "answer": "HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol used by the Web, designed to enable communications between clients and servers. It works as a request-response protocol between a client and a server. The client, usually a browser, sends a request to the server; the server then responds to the request with the content of the webpage.",
      "hint": "HTTP is a request-response protocol.",
      "notes": "HTTP methods, such as GET and POST, define the type of request being made.",
      "references": [

    {
      "question": "Explain what DNS is and its role in the Internet.",
      "answer": "DNS (Domain Name System) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like www.example.com. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Essentially, it resolves human-readable names to machine-readable IP addresses.",
      "hint": "DNS translates domain names to IP addresses.",
      "notes": "Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which DNS maps the domain names to.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?",
      "answer": "HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted using TLS (or SSL), which protects the data from man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdroppers.",
      "hint": "HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.",
      "notes": "Using HTTPS, the data transferred over the network is encrypted.",
      "references": [

    {
      "question": "What is a CDN and how does it benefit web development?",
      "answer": "A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a system of distributed servers that deliver pages and other web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and the content delivery server. CDNs are used to improve the speed and efficiency of web content delivery by caching content in multiple locations around the world.",
      "hint": "CDN stands for Content Delivery Network.",
      "notes": "CDNs reduce latency and improve site speed by providing content from servers close to the user's location.",
      "references": [

    {
      "question": "Explain the concept of 'cookies' in web development.",
      "answer": "Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items in a shopping cart) or to record the user's browsing activity. They can also be used for user authentication, storing site preferences, and delivering personalized content.",
      "hint": "Cookies store data used to identify users and possibly prepare customized web pages.",
      "notes": "Cookies are managed via HTTP headers sent between the server and the client.",
      "references": [
        "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies",
        "https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp"
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "What are RESTful APIs and how do they work?",
      "answer": "RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) are architectural style web services that provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. They allow requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.",
      "hint": "RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.",
      "notes": "In a RESTful API, each URL is a request for an object, and the HTTP method specifies the operation on the object.",
      "references": [

      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "How do web sockets work, and when would you use them?",
      "answer": "WebSockets provide a way to open a bidirectional, persistent communication channel between the client and server. Once a WebSocket connection is established, the server can send data to the client without being solicited by the client, and vice versa. This is particularly useful for real-time applications like live notifications and interactive games.",
      "hint": "WebSockets allow for real-time data transfer between the client and server.",
      "notes": "WebSockets are ideal when low latency is crucial, as in video games or trading platforms.",
      "references": [
        "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API",
